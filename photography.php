A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</p>

                        <p>I work with a wide range of clients, from business and professional people who need corporate images, to individuals who want to capture a snapshot of their lives. Photography is my passion and if I have to honest, my work is all about feelings. Photography for me is to capture everything around, unexpected moments cherished with happiness. </p>

                        <p>As a professional freelance photographer I take photos of people for many different uses, most often for websites, publications and social media profiles, and sometimes for personal use. Usually I create headshots for businesses and professionals, location portraits at client premises or around London, and studio portrait photography.</p>
