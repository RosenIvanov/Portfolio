                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em"><strong>Content writing</strong> is a form of online writing which is closely linked to web marketing campaigns. This means creating the writing which appears on websites that are designed to sell or promote a specific product. Content writers work according to the brief provided by a client. This brief will define their task and any SEO related requirements, such as keyword density.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em">Content writing comes in many forms, the one that I offer and the most common are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Article Writing</li>
                            <li>Blog Writing</li>
                            <li>Search Engine Optimization Writing</li>
                            <li>Website Copywriting</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4" style="margin-top: 1em;">
                        <p>The online world is very different compared to content on paper. Content writing is almost always related to SEO marketing campaigns. The quality of the content produced also needs to be high. There’s power in words… showcase your brand with dynamic web content.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">What your website says can be the difference between a sale and losing a customer. The idea is to get your message across in an easy to read manner, without losing your audience attention and interest in the message you are trying to convey. An average online webpage only has a few seconds to leave a lasting impression on visitors. High quality content will ensure that these keywords appear in the right density. And this is where a web content writer comes into play! </p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;"> Grabbing the attention of the audience and engaging the online audience is what I can do best. I consider myself as a really professional copywriter who understands that web content writing is a serious challenge which is why you should only entrust professionals with your web content. Each page of content I provide will be researched, written, edit and proofread to ensure that you receive original, unique content that you can publish immediately. </p>
