                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1em"><strong>A website content management system (usually shortened to just "CMS")</strong> allows you to change the text and images on your website easily - by visiting a page somewhere, entering your user name and password to log in, clicking a link or two, typing something and pressing Save. It is a system to let you manage the content of your website - without technical training. Using this uncomplicated system you can have an unlimited number of pages and a full site-search engine. With a CMS, much of the information in your site will probably be stored in a database somewhere, instead of in unchanging files. So CMS websites are also database-driven instead of static. And last but not least, it comes with easy to use admin panel just for you and your preffered language! </p>

                        <p>CMSs are powerful, so they must also have some method of authentication - meaning that you have to login somewhere - with your email address or username and a fairly complicated password - in order to use it.It provides easy to use admin panel and thousands of plugins specially built to help you and your business.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 2em;">My preferred platform is WordPress, it is flexible, powerful and easy to use. You will really enjoy being able to easily update your website pages without the need for a web designer. I have created entire sites using CMS or created customised CMS elements for existing sites allowing site owners to have bespoke solutions to their exact requirements often making updating for the site owners very simple and even a pleasure! WordPress plugin architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or blog. WordPress has over 49,394 plugins available, each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs. These customizations range from search engine optimization, to client portals used to display private information to logged in users, to content management systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of widgets and navigation bars. </p>

                        <p>Many companies find it difficult to keep their web site content as up to date as they would like. Often there are delays getting new content online, the site stagnates and your clients get to see outdated information and Google may well relegate you in its listings. That is why so many companies are turning to CMS. Content management systems reduce the time required to publish, allowing you to get your content on-line faster. Your marketing team can keep your business relevant by multi-channel campaign management (e.g. emails, brochures, RSS, hypersites, dynamic content management etc.). Most CMS software is web based, which means that you can access and edit your site from any computer with an internet connection. No specific software needs to be installed. </p>
